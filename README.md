### Project description
We used [TRAK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14186) to examine the effect of removing observations from the dataset on performance of the model finetuned on this dataset.

The model we used was a pretrained [ResNet-18](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-18).
It is a pretrained model that we experimented with by finetuning it on a subset of the [Food101](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nateraw/food101) dataset.
